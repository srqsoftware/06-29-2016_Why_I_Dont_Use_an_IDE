#Why I Don't Use an IDE

[Stratus3D](http://github.com/Stratus3D)

##Abstract

As developers we strive to maximize our productivity by using tools that streamline workflow and by automating as many things as possible. An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is software that is intended to streamline a developer's workflow by handling setup of the development environment and providing an easy to use GUI. While IDEs make many things easy they come at a cost of flexibility, transparency, and even developer productivity. By using a set of individual tools instead of an IDE we can create an environment that is extremely customizable and allows for greater productivity than that of a traditional IDE. In this talk I'll talk about my decision to not use an IDE and how I came to use the set of tools that I do now. I also demo the setup I have and go over the basics of each tool I use.
